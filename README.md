Welcome to my Weather App project! This web application provides real-time weather information based on user-selected locations. One standout feature is the extensive city dataset, allowing users to search and select from a comprehensive list of cities globally. I've designed and implemented this app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with weather data fetched from the Rapid API.

## Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive design for a seamless user experience.
Dynamic Weather Updates: Utilizes the Rapid API to fetch up-to-date weather information.
City Search: Queries a dataset of cities around the world, giving users the flexibility to choose any location.

## Tech Stack:

HTML: For structuring the content and layout.<br>
CSS: Styling the user interface, making it visually appealing.<br>
JavaScript: Implementing dynamic functionality, handling API requests, and updating the UI.<br>

## How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
Open the index.html file in your web browser.<br>
Enter the desired location or choose from the extensive city list to get instant weather updates!<br>
Feel free to explore the codebase, suggest improvements, or contribute to making it even better. Your feedback is highly appreciated! ‚ö°<br>
